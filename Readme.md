# Fyle Internship Challenge (2024)

## Search github Users

This application is a simple, yet powerful tool for viewing GitHub repositories. It uses the GitHub API to fetch repository data for a specified user and displays it in a user-friendly format.

The application is built with **Vanilla JavaScript** for DOM manipulation, which means it doesn't rely on any JavaScript libraries or frameworks. This makes the application lightweight and efficient.
